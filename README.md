# CAUPER
This paper proposes CAUPER(short for Causal Performance Debugging) that enables users toidentify, explain, and 
fix the root cause of non-functional faults early and in a principled fashion. CAUPER builds a causal model by 
observing the performance of the system under different configurations. Then, it uses casual path extraction 
followed by counterfactual reasoning over the causal model to:  (a) identify the root causes of non-functional faults, 
(b) estimate the effects of various configurable parameters on the performance objective(s), and (c) prescribe candidate 
repairs to the relevant configuration options to fix the non-functional fault. 
## Dependencies

## Run Instructions
To run experiments on NVIDIA Jetson TX1 or TX2 Xavier devices please use the 
following command to launch a flask on localhost:
```python
command: python RunService.py softwaresystem
```
For example to initialize a flask app with image recogntion softwrae system please use:
```python
command: python RunService.py Image
```

Once the flask app is running and modelserver is ready then please use the following command
to collect performance measurments for different configurations: 
```python
command: python RunParams.py softwaresystem
```

To run causal models for a single-objective bug please run the following:
```python
command: python Runcausal_model.py  -o objective1 -d datafile -s softwaresystem -k hardwaresystem
```
For example, to build causal models using NOTEARS and fci for image recognition software 
system in TX1 with initial datafile irtx1.csv use the following for a latency (single objective) bug : 
```python
command: python Runcausal_model.py  -o inference_time -d irtx1.csv -s Image -k TX1
```

To run causal models for a multi-objective bug please run the following:
```python
command: python Runcausal_model.py  -o objective1 -o objective2 -d datafile -s softwaresystem -k hardwaresystem
```
For example, to build causal models using NOTEARS and fci for image recognition software 
system in TX1 with initial datafile irtx1.csv use the following for a latency and energy consumption (multi-ojective) bug : 
```python
command: python Runcausal_model.py  -o inference_time -o total_energy_consumption -d irtx1.csv -s Image -k TX1
```
